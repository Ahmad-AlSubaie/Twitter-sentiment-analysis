Ahmad Alsubaie and Jason Yin
CS499 NLP project
Our goal for this project is that we are replicating the results of an NLP research paper (https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM10/paper/view/1536/1842) in order to use a developer Twitter account to retrieve tweets from Twitter for natural language processing.  We will process the tweets for sentiment analysis, which will predict whether a piece of information/text will indicate positive, negative, or neutral mood on a certain topic.  We plan to use Python to implement the sentiment analysis program.
We will be comparing sentiment analysis results between Gallup polls, Opinionfinder, and a basic Neural Net. The envisioned input would be keywords or hashtags from the user. The envisioned output would be the sentiment analysis of the social media tweets that are relating to the keywords/hashtags that were entered.  This project can be helpful to people because it can help with social media management and marketing.  Jason is a social media specialist at an IT company for work. This line of work involves being able to look at social media content and analyze the tone, sentiment, and overall value of posts for marketing and customer appeal purposes.  The work is a lot of analyzing and some program like this one can help analyze what social media topics garner positive and/or negative attention.
